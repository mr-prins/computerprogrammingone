This is an introductory course in program engineering and applications. This course introduces students to the fundamentals of computer programming. Throughout the semester, students will learn to design, code, and test their own programs while applying mathematical concepts. They will also be exposed to problem-solving techniques while approaching coding challenges, with the goal to prepare them for a more advanced programming course in the future. To achieve this objective, we will use the Python programming language, one of the most vastly used coding languages out there. However, with the concepts learned in this course, the student will be able to learn any other languages on their own, if they so desire. Course Objectives Students will be familiar with IDEs. Students will understand program development methodology and best practices. Students will understand and implement key programming concepts. Students will understand and implement control structures. Students will be aware of career opportunities in the Computer Programming/Software Engineering industry. This Is What This Course Is Not Students will NOT become hackers in this course. Students will NOT learn how to fix computers in this course. Students will NOT know how to create a web page for a company in this course. Students will NOT become expert programmers or geniuses in this course. For Parents This website was designed to offer you some insight about what your child is learning in class. It will also serve as some sort of calendar, so you know which assignments your child has to complete and when they have to complete it. I also want to make sure you understand that you can reach out to me whenever you want if you have any questions or concerns. I want to make sure your child has the best education possible, but you have to be involved for this to be more easily achievable. If we work together, we can ensure your child will have better chances to succeed in life. Your child will probably need to study at home to complete this course successfully. Please encourage them to do so.","title":"About"},{"location":"#welcome-to-computer-programming-i","text":"This is an introductory course in program engineering and applications.
